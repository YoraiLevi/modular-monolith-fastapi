# TODOs
* Add script for openapi.json generation for individual apps and aggregate apps
* Implement a better schema for validating config.yaml for aggregate app config
* Implement easy "run as microservices" script, a way to run individual application from config? a way to re"orchestrate"/split aggregate app
* Add containerization scripts
* integration testing for communicating apps, not just mocking
* working CI/CD that doesn't always fail
* consider if to generalize config.yaml into "fully text configureable application" aka we can choose routes and dependencies etc and type the component import strings and aggregate them into an application rather than implementing them and aggregating apps
